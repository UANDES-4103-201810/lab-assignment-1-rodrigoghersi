Base project for lab assignment 1

1.- In the elements tab, we can find a structure composed mainly by a head and a body. Where the head contains some tags such as:

meta: Defines metadata about an HTML document, in this case, the name ¨referrer¨, ¨viewport¨ and the content ¨origin¨ for example.
link: Defines the relationship between a document and an external resource, such as href="news.css?XmeMkOgGRBw9auMJ1Y7Q" for example.
title: is where the title of the webpage is, in this case being ¨Hacker News¨

And where the body contains tags like:

center: it defines centered text
table: defines a table
tbody: it groups the body content in a table ( it needs to be inside a table of course)
script: it is used to define a client-side script, it usualy contains scripting statements or points to an external script dile through the src attribute. 
In thid case, it contains the script type ¨javascript¨ and the source "hn.js?XmeMkOgGRBw9auMJ1Y7Q"

2.- A)in the first file called (index) we can find what would be the index of the page, it contains a table with the titles of the news of the page with the stats of each of them,
 such as points, user that published it, time since it was published and number of coments. It also contains the type of letter,
 color and font size.

    B) the second file contains the functions needed for the page to work

    C) the third one contains the desing of the page, like color of the backbround, size of the margins, source of the images, color of the letters, among other things

    D) the remaining files are .gif files wich animates the page.

3.- the xhr lets developers:

	-Update a web page without reloading the page
	-Request data from a server - after the page has loaded
	-Receive data from a server  - after the page has loaded
	-Send data to a server - in the background

considering this information, one could say that the files are loaded in different times (the ones mentoned in the points above)

4.-The connection to this site is using a valid, trusted server certificate issued by COMODO RSA Domain Validation Secure Server CA. and it will be 
valid until 21-08-2019
